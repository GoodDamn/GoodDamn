# Hi Mobile development ðŸ‘‹

Hi, you dont't know my name yet :)

I'm 20 years old boy with IT enjoying

I'm currenty mobile developer on both popular platforms
(I think, you know them)

* iOS
* Android

## âœ¨ Skills

* Base tech stack is:
* * Network-Socket programming from scratch
  * OpenGL ES 2.0+
  * Firebase Database, Storage, Auth, Messaging
  * TCP/IP
  * YooKassa and Brevo APIs
  * MVC / MVVM

## Platform stack:

* Android:
* * Android SDK for Tablets and smarts
  * Java / Kotlin
  * Canvas (forever)
  * Android studio
  * SQLite / SharedPreferences (I don't care of it, I usually write data to files and read it from byte to byte using buffers and input streams :) )
  * OkHttp
  * Gradle

* iOS:
* * iOS SDK for iPhones and iPads
  * UIKit, GLKit, NetworkKit (Swift UI sucks)
  * CoreGraphics (not Canvas, but ok)

## ðŸ›  Pet projects

### [Android Server](https://github.com/GoodDamn/SocketServer)

* Kotlin + Sockets + Android SDK

Simple server working on Android OS.
Now I'm implementing HTTP-Server for responsing to reqeusts with HTTP

### [TraceView](https://github.com/GoodDamn/TraceView)

* Canvas + Java + Android SDK

For Android, I use it for advanced user interaction.
If you draw it, you complete it

It's an extension for my ScriptEngine, but it's under a policy, sorry(

### [Microphone Breathing](https://github.com/GoodDamn/MicroBreath)
(Warning: you can damage your microphone, try it on your own risk)

* Canvas + Kotlin + Coroutines + Android SDK + Multithreading

It's a part of advanced UX/UI for user interaction
For example, for some breathing exercises
